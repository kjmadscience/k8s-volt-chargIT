1. Configure all variable values in configmap yaml , update all volt config in properties.yaml -----  templating ? jenkins ui later?
[hostnames: "mydb-voltdb-cluster-0.mydb-voltdb-cluster-internal.kjadeja.svc.cluster.local"
  recordcount: "1000000"
  load_data_tpms: "20"
  maxinitialcredit: "500"
  tpms: "30"
  durationseconds: "300"
  queryseconds: "120"
  kv_tpms: "20"
  kv_durationseconds: "60"
  kv_queryseconds: "10"
  kv_jsonsize: "1024"   #check documentation
  kv_deltaproportion: "0" #check documentation
  del_tpms: "40"
  kafkaserverplusport: ""
  kafka_recordcount: ""
  kafka_tpms: ""
  kafka_durationseconds: ""
  kafka_max_amount: ""]
2. Load schema
 - copy jar gson-2.2.2.jar, voltdb-chargingdemo.jar inside a volt container at /tmp/
 - kubectl exec -it mydb-voltdb-cluster-0 -- sqlcmd < create_db.sql

3. Load User Data
 - create job to upsert configured user data. 

wait for job to complete

4. Run transactions
 - create job to run configured TPS transactions

-- here, we may want to have an option to start multiple jobs if user wants, for example, 50K x 4 clients 

5. Run the KV demo for this dataset (optional)
 - create job to run configured TPS transactions

-- here, we may want to have an option to start multiple jobs if user wants, for example, 50K x 4 clients 

6. run Kafka Credit run (optional)
- kafka setup, or volt topics setup handled for this
 - create job to run configured TPS transactions

-- here, we may want to have an option to start multiple jobs if user wants, for example, 50K x 4 clients

7. Delete charging data (clean up) (optional) - in k8s do we need clean up? or just a helm uninstall followed by install

------

during the run, i want the run start and end time stamps noted for relevant monitoring dashboards

a thought: 
what about datadog? d11 uses it, we have a "free" sandbox, AFAIK its free, i could be wrong. 
Managed solution, just few yamls and new metrics system can report to datadog - however, i tried to test it, those few yamls didnt work for me, yet!
d11 uses it, we provide dashboards for them anywaysssss.
